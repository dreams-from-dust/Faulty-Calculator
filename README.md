# Faulty Calculator

A retro-themed calculator that demonstrates core JavaScript principles. This project simulates a "faulty" calculator where results can be intentionally incorrect, showcasing a fun application of conditional logic, DOM manipulation, and a touch of randomness.

### Key Features

* **Core JavaScript Logic:** The calculator utilizes JavaScript to handle user input, perform calculations, and implement its unique logic. For every calculation, the program generates a random number. If the number is less than or equal to `0.5`, it returns a slightly incorrect result, demonstrating a playful application of conditional logic. If the number is greater then `0.5`, the correct result is displayed. **This random number is generated in the background and is not visible to the user.**
* **DOM Manipulation:** JavaScript is used to dynamically update the result display and show error messages based on user actions and calculation outcomes.
* **Event Handling:** The calculator uses event listeners on buttons to trigger functions for calculation and resetting the interface.
* **Modern CSS:** The interface is styled with a modern, retro-inspired theme using Google Fonts and a dark color palette. The layout is responsive, ensuring usability on both desktop and mobile devices.
* **Robust Error Handling:** The JavaScript includes checks for invalid number inputs, incorrect operators, and prevents errors like division by zero.

### Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript (ES6+)
